## Plasmid/circular elements information

(Mostly from Alex C.)

Additionally, the circular elements identified by VirSorter2 as viruses are located here: 
intermediate-outputs/circular_contigs_flye/RC/Removed_due_to_full_VS2_score

A full list of all RecurM clusters, with the associated GeNomad scores and putative host taxonomy based on mapping to known plasmids in the IMG/PR database (which is separate to the relative co-abundance host linkage using FlashWeave) is located here: 

intermediate-outputs/circular_contigs_flye/RC/results/circular_processed.tsv


A list of all contigs that belong to a cluster (so that you can check whether they all encode the same gene of interest) are here: 

circular_contigs_flye/RC/results/cluster_contigs_information.tsv

All extracted circular Flye contigs are here: 

intermediate-outputs/circular_contigs_flye/*.fna
